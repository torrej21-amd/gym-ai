GYMBro: AI-Powered Fitness Tracker 
GymBro is an AI-driven fitness assistant currently under development, designed to empower gym-goers with personalized insights and data-backed training support. Built by a developer who lives the gym life, this app is made for lifters, by a lifter — blending cutting-edge machine learning with hands-on fitness experience.

Tech Stack 
Python 3.13 – Core development language
OpenAI API – GPT-powered logic & smart AI interaction
Pandas – Data manipulation & analysis
Matplotlib – Custom data visualizations (user patterns, progress, etc.)
TensorFlow – ML engine for mood & workout prediction (coming in V2)
venv + PowerShell – Local virtual environment & scripting
GitHub – Source control & version tracking

Development Phases
V1 (Current) – Core front-end UI built in Streamlit, GPT-integrated logic, hardcoded user simulation, CSV data ingestion, visualization with Matplotlib, clean UI output
V2 (Planned) – Integrate TensorFlow to analyze user input patterns and build predictive ML models for gym behavior, energy levels, and consistency
V3 (Planned) – Secure user authentication, personalized learning from input history, adaptive coaching logic tailored per user (AI personal trainer vibe)

Status
Development: Early-stage (V1 nearly complete)
Storage: No persistent backend yet (CSV input/output; future DB support planned)
Goal: Fully AI-powered gym assistant that adapts to each user’s journey
